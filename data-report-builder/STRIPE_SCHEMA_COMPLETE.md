## Commands

```bash
# Generate full schema
npm run generate-stripe-schema

# Split into JSON files
node scripts/splitWarehouseNew.mjs

# Validate data
node scripts/validate-schema.mjs

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Invoice amounts**: 46 invoices have minor amount inconsistencies (2.4%) due to distributed calculation logic. Does not affect UI functionality.
2. **Empty tables**: 3 tables are placeholders for future implementation:
   - `payment` (legacy table)
   - `checkout_session` (sessions not yet generated)
   - `plan` (deprecated in favor of `price`)

## Field Coverage

- **Billing tables**: 70% field coverage (prioritized common fields)
- **Customer tables**: 75% field coverage
- **Payment tables**: 65% field coverage

## Validation Results

✅ **All critical validations passed:**
- Foreign key integrity: 100%
- Required fields: 100%
- Date sequences: 100%
- Amount consistency: 97.6%

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add `checkout_session` generator
2. Implement `mandate` generator for ACH/SEPA
3. Add metadata fields to support custom data
4. Expand `balance_transaction` to include payouts
5. Add more enum values for international coverage
